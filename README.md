### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eric, a passionate University Student delving into the fascinating realms of Computational and Data Science. Python aficionado and data wrangler extraordinaire, I'm all about transforming messy datasets into actionable insights.

ðŸ”¬ Currently exploring the intersection of data science and finance as a part-time Financial Consultant, I thrive on crunching numbers and uncovering hidden patterns.

ðŸ’» When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring the latest trends and technologies in the data science world or brainstorming new project ideas over a cup of coffee (or two... or three).

ðŸš€ Let's connect and collaborate on exciting data-driven projects or swap stories about our coding adventures! Hit me up, and let's geek out over data together!
